# K-Means-Clustering-
A Python implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch to group students based on their data attributes using the student_clustering.csv dataset.

## 📚 K-Means Clustering on Student Dataset (From Scratch in Python)

This project implements the **K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch** (without using any external machine learning libraries) on a custom student dataset. The objective is to group students based on their features (like marks, skills, behavior, etc.).

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `student_clustering.csv`, which contains anonymized features for students. These could include:
- Age
- CGPA / Marks
- Study Hours
- Participation
- Skill Level

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- ✅ Implement **K-Means Clustering** from scratch using Python
- ✅ Load and process data manually using built-in libraries
- ✅ Visualize the clusters formed
- ✅ Evaluate clustering using visual or intra-cluster patterns

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Euclidean Distance Calculation
- Centroid Initialization
- Iterative Assignment and Update of Centroids
- Cluster Convergence Detection
